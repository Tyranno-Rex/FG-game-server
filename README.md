This repository is for the soccer-game project.

The objectives of the project are as follows:

Implementation of a 2D soccer server based on Unreal Engine: In this project, I aim to implement a game server using the dedicated server model. However, I also plan to incorporate elements from the SPICA and P2P models, as discussed in NDC, to minimize server load and create a more efficient game server.
AI Reinforcement Learning: The goal is to develop AI with more natural movements through reinforcement learning, providing a more realistic soccer experience.
Timeline: August 15, 2024 â€“ December 31, 2025

The aim is to develop a project that can be used for the school's capstone design and to prepare in advance.

readme will be update more.
